Adds [Polymorph](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/polymorph) support for [Ars Nouveau](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ars-nouveau)'s Storage Lecterns, allowing you to craft items that use the same ingredients from the Storage Lectern's terminal.

When a group of ingredients matches more than one recipe, a button will appear above the output slot. Pushing this button will show a list of all possible results and selecting one will change the crafting output to match. Polymorph will also remember the last selection as long as the ingredients don't change, so repeated crafting actions are possible on the same selection.
